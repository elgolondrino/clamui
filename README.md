# ClamUI
## A KF5 UI for ClamAV.

The goal of this application is to create an easy to use frontend for ClamAV (Clam Anti Virus).

#### Planned main features:
- Scan an external data medium automatically when connected.
- A service menu to scan files or directories in Dolphin.
- A device action to scan connected external storage devices.
- Virus scanning at scheduled times.
- Update the virus definitions at scheduled times.
- Exclude selected files and directories from virus scanning.
- Manage quarantined files.

#### Depends on:
- Qt5
- KF5

#### Requires:
- ClamAV


### Notes:
#### 2015-05-10.
At this time I can't give a date for a testing release of this program.
Because I am too busy with my main job.
